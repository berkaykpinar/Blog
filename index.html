      <h1>Types of Coffee Beans</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Arabica</h2>
        <p>
          The most commonly used and widely available bean, Arabica accounts
          for 60 percent of the world's coffee production. Originating
          hundreds of years ago in the highlands of Ethiopia, and likely
          popularized in 7th Century Arabia (hence the name), it's actually
          quite delicate and difficult to grow — meaning its prevalence
          doesn't necessarily translate to commodity prices. Often found under
          gourmet labels, high-quality Arabica is smooth and complex, with a
          notable lack of bitterness.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Robusta</h2>
        <p>
          The second most popular bean, Robusta is hearty and disease
          resistant (which also accounts for the name). It originated in
          sub-Saharan Africa, which continues to be one of the primary
          growers, along with Indonesia. A more budget-friendly choice,
          instant coffee is generally comprised of 100 percent Robusta. The
          high-in-caffeine bean can have harsher, more bitter qualities, which
          is why it's also often found in blends, especially in Vietnam.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Liberica</h2>
        <p>
          Rarely found in North American and European markets (accounting for
          a mere two percent of the world's coffee supply), Liberica is almost
          exclusively produced in Malaysia, and especially favored in the
          Philippines. It is known for having an inconsistent flavor;
          sometimes smoky and woody, sometimes floral, with a rather harsh
          finish.
        </p>

      <h1>Types of Coffee Roasts</h1>
      <p style="margin-top: 50px;margin-bottom: 50px;">
        Just as there are different types of coffee, there are also a variety
        of roasts, which have a marked effect on your java's final result. A
        blond and toasty light roast has high levels of acidity and caffeine,
        a nut brown medium roast has balanced flavor, aroma, and acidity, a
        dark roast is full bodied and heavy with low-caffeine content and a
        faintly spicy flavor, while a mahogany-colored, extra dark roast is
        bitter, smoky, and burnt, with the lowest caffeine of all.

      <h1>Types of Brewing Methods</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Drip</h2>
        <p>
          The most common way to produce traditional black coffee, medium
          grounds are added to a brew basket and run through an automatic
          machine.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Pour Over</h2>
        <p>
          A more refined way to make a stronger brew, boiling water is poured
          slowly over fine grounds set in a filter basket, which drips into a
          cup.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Espresso</h2>
        <p>
          Pressurized hot water passes through a filter containing finely
          ground, dark roasted beans. The force produces an especially
          concentrated shot.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
        <p>
          Coarsely ground coffee steeps in room temperature water for an
          extended period of time, resulting in a low-acidity, high-caffeine
          brew that's excellent enjoyed cold.

        <h2>Espresso vs. Black Coffee</h2>
        <p>
          Both black coffee and espresso are made by steeping beans with hot
          water, so what's the difference between the two then? As explained
          above, espresso is made of finely ground, extra-dark beans, that are
          run through a pressurized machine that produces only one,
          highly-concentrated shot at a time. Black coffee is more simple and
          humble: hot water dripped over ground coffee beans for a low- to
          medium-concentration of coffee and caffeine.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Cappuccino vs. Latte</h2>
        <p>
          They're both smooth and creamy coffee shop go-tos, but the
          difference between a cappuccino and latte is largely a matter of
          proportion. The distinctly layered cappuccino has an even
          distribution of steamed milk, foamed milk, and espresso, while the
          latte is heavy on steamed milk (which is blended with, rather than
          layered on top, of the espresso), and light on foam.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Americano</h2>
        <p>
          An alternative to plain, black drip coffee, the Americano consists
          of an espresso shot diluted with hot water.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Mocha</h2>
        <p>
          Essentially a cappuccino, with a cocoa kick and creaminess from
          steamed milk.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Macchiato</h2>
        <p>
          Combine three parts foam with one part espresso, and you're holding
          a macchiato. It's not as creamy and smooth as a cappuccino, but it's
          not as strong as a straight shot of espresso either.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Irish Coffee</h2>
        <p>
          More cocktail than coffee drink, an Irish coffee is a combination of
          coffee, sugar, cream, and whiskey. This Irish coffee recipe is a
          great introduction.
